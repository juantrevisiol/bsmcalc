Black-Scholes-Merton calculator for python

This is an option calculator. You can calculate any type of options and their implied volatilities. 
In addition, it enables you to calculate the Greeks of the options and it has the Brown-Robinson formula (2002) 
to account for the Skewness and Kurtosis of the asset returns (or the non-normality of them).
